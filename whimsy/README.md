<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## About the Project
We were tasked with creating a Cross-Platform Mobile Development application, through the use of react n ative and firebas - following a concept of our choosing that was centered around a competition. 

I chose to create a bed time story competition website, and thus, came up with the concept of Whimsy! A fun application that encourages an exciting and nostalgic user experience!

### Project Description
Whimsy is a mobile app that hosts a bedtime story competition for aspiring writers. Users can choose their preferred genre and compete to see who can write the best bedtime short story. The winning story will be added to the prestigious "Dreamland Storybook," a collection of captivating short stories. Having a story featured in this book increases the chances of being discovered by publishers.

The main purpose of this competition is to provide writers with a platform to showcase their work, improve their writing skills, and gain recognition. Additionally, the app serves as a free library of enchanting short stories for those who may not have easy access to physical books, thus benefiting the community. Whimsy not only fosters creativity but also allows users to immerse themselves in a magical world, inspiring their imagination and storytelling abilities.

By participating in Whimsy, users become "creators" of the Dreamworld, contributing to the creation of new forms of life through their stories. This sense of unity and collective creation fosters a virtual public library that can be enjoyed by children all over the world.

### Built With
* [ReactNative]
* [Firebase]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The following steps and isntructions will allow you to copy the project on your local machine for development, practising and testing purposes.


### How to Install
# Whimsy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


## Concept Process
`Conceptual Process`
#### Brainstorm
In order to ensure that Code Quest exudes a distinct brand identity, We initially brainstormed ideas of how we could create a user friendly website, that would appeal to the developers of Open Window.

#### Mood boards
Once we had a general idea of the identity of our website - we created mood boards and discussed the stylistic approach we would take. We ultimately decided on a clean, minimalistic style with quirky illustrations. Balancing professional and fun.

#### Wireframes
Lastly, we began wireframing  -this allowed for smoother front-end development,

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` encompasses the technical implementation and functionality in the frontend and backend of the application.

After finalizing the designs, we started the implementation phase.

We created the database structure for stories and users, which provided a foundation for implementing the required functionality.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->
We utilized React Native, a free and open-source framework for mobile app development, to create this project. React Native enabled us to build the application using a single codebase, resulting in a cross-platform app.

Firebase, a comprehensive suite of backend services, was used for user authentication and storing story data. Firebase Authentication ensured secure user login and registration, while Firestore database provided a scalable and real-time storage solution.


* Utilized and implemented React Native for the frontend.
* Integrated Firebase for user authentication and data storage.
* Implemented user registration, login, and profile management features.



### The Functionality

#### Story Competition
Whimsy offers a captivating story competition where users can choose their preferred genre and showcase their writing skills. They can submit their short stories and compete against other participants to win recognition and the opportunity to be featured in the Dreamland Storybook.

#### User Authentication
To participate in the competition, users need to register and create an account. Whimsy integrates Firebase Authentication, enabling secure user registration, login, and password management.

#### Dreamland Storybook
The Dreamland Storybook is a collection of extraordinary short stories submitted by talented writers. It serves as a virtual public library, offering a wide range of captivating bedtime stories for children to enjoy.

#### Manage each location
Like, bookmark, edit and more! Our priority is giving our users control.



### Challenges, Highlights & learnings

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you experienced with the project -->
Building a cross-platform mobile app with React Native posed some challenges, such as ensuring consistent UI/UX across different devices and handling platform-specific nuances. However, with careful research and testing, we were able to overcome these challenges and deliver a seamless user experience.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlights you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
One of the highlights of this project was witnessing the integration of Firebase services, particularly user authentication and real-time data updates. Firebase simplified the development process and allowed us to focus on the core functionalities of Whimsy.


### Learnings
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
This project provided valuable insights into building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and Firebase. We gained a better understanding of integrating backend services, managing user authentication, and leveraging real-time data updates.

In the future, we can explore additional features to enhance Whimsy, such as rating and reviewing stories, social sharing options, and personalized reading recommendations based on user preferences..

### Future Implementation
In future, I would like to explore more above and beyond features. In addition to this, I would like to implement loaders to further enhance the user experience.
